## Introduction
This is my personal Neovim config, but feel free to use the config.

My major language is C/CPP, along with little Python and Rust.

So this config is friendly to C/CPP users, and may be friendly to Python and Rust users someday.

## Requirements
1. neovim
2. git
3. python < 3.12
4. fzf
5. fd
6. ripgrep
7. nodejs
8. cmake
9. microsoft c++ toolset
10. a nerd font
11. cmake-language-server (from pip)
